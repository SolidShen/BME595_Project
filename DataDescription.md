# Data Description
The data has been prepared for training and validation in the NIFTI format.
## *Data Structure*
- There are in total 30 (9 shame control, 11 unoperated control, and 10 VNS) subjects for both raw images and stomach segmentation labels. 
- For each subject, a 4D gastric MRI volume is acquired, for which the third dimension is the number of acquired slices, and the forth dimension is the number of time frames.
- One single image is 256 by 256; one single 4D volume has 30 slices. 
- Some of them have 18 frames: sub 11, sub 12 in the unoperated control group.
- Some have 17 frames: sub 1, sub 2, sub 3, sub 4, and sub 9 in the sham control group; sub 10, sub 14 in the unoperated control group; sub 21, sub 26, sub 27, sub 28 in the VNS group.
- Some have 16 frames: sub 5, sub 6, sub 7 in the sham control group; sub 15, sub 23, sub 24, and sub 30 in the VNS group.
- Some have 15 frames: sub 8 in the sham control group, sub 13, sub 16, sub 17, and sub 19 in the unoperated control group; sub 25, sub 29 in the VNS group.
- Some have 14 frames: sub 20 in the unoperated control group, sub 22 in the VNS grou
- Some have 13 frames: sub 18 in the unoperated control group.
